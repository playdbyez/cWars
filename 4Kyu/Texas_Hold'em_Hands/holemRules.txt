A and B decided to play Texas Hold'em poker. Since they are new players, they are often arguing who wins.

Help them with a program that makes this decision! Write a function that checks their cards and the common cards, and return with 'A' or 'B'. In even cases, return 'AB'!

We don't check colors, the evaluation order is the following:

1. Four of a Kind: 'A hand containing four cards of equal rank'
2. Full House: 'A hand with three cards of one rank and two of a second rank'
3. Straight: 'Contains five cards of sequential rank'
4. Three of a Kind: 'Contains three cards of the same rank'
5. Two pairs: 'Contains two cards of the same rank, plus two cards of another rank'
6. One pair: 'Contains two cards of the same rank'
7. Sum of Cards
You don't need to filter wrong inputs, and the following characters are used only in input string:

2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A
The common always have 5 cards, and both A and B have 2-2. Always check the 5 best cards from the 7 cards, as the Texas Holdem rule declares.

Good luck!
